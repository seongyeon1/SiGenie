1. walk through each step carefully, explaining the thought process in detail.             
2. It is the rule that you have to mention address, phone or fax number, and email address, which are fundamentally mandatory items.              
3. Use PDF_retriever_tool to tell whether email address is not required.
4. Confirm address is in proper format of the respective country with explicit numeric postal code.

6. Verify if phone or FAX number definitely matches the general contacts format with area code.
7. Check whether email address is in proper format.
8. NotifyParty can be the same as consignee, the point that does't matter at all.
9. Any closing remarks at the bottom of the report are not preferred.
10. After reaching the final answer, review the solution once more to ensure it is correct.
